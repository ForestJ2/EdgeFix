# Let Me Use IE

I know, I know, Internet Explorer sucks. If no one had to use it we'd have a perfect world. Unfortunately we don't live in a perfect world, and some systems require us to use Internet Explorer.

# Usage

Either download just the EXE, or download the repo via the button in the top right. No installation is required, but in order for the software to preform the necessary modifications Administrator privileges will be needed.

Right click the software where you have it stored, and select the "Run as administrator" option. You'll see the changes being done in real time, and you'll be prompted to press Enter to exit.
